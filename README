Here are the slides and examples I used for the Simple Sinatra Scripts presentation to Alamo Coders on October 13, 2010. To run the presentation you will need Showoff(http://github.com/schacon/showoff), and to run the examples you will need Sinatra(http://www.sinatrarb.com/).

The examples are very simple, their name should explain exactly what they do. panic.rb seemed to generate the most interest during the meeting; it simply runs a script, sets the background color of the page, then schedules a refresh in 4 seconds.
